This is HoneyInsured.com, a health insurance recommendation engine.

Unfortunately, we had to shutdown last year due to a lack of funding and uncertainly around the Affordable Care Act last year. But to give back to community, we've decided to open source our code!

A functional version is still working at https://honeyinsured.com, but some functions such as doctor search and enrollement no longer work and the data is outdated.

For those looking for affordable health insurance, here's what you should know:

Insurance basics: First, insurance is a tradeoff. You pay more for insurance or pay more when accidents happen. You also pay more for insurance to not be limited to smaller networks and to not require referrals to see specialists.

Second, always check that your doctor is in-network. Insurance companies have contracts with doctors - so when you buy a plan, you get to see the in-network doctors at a lower price. You can add multiple doctors and our recommendation will try to find the best plan with your doctors in-network.

Third, insurance plans are priced according to how the average person utilizes the different benefits and not you. So if you have a condition where you’re spending a lot on drugs, then you should find a plan that has a better benefits for drugs. You can tell us that by editing our breakdown numbers or just sliding to where you spend annually.

Fourth, pay attention to network size. One of the common strategies that insurance companies use is that they offer cheap plans but the plans have a very small network of doctors.

In places with many plans, it’s common for a plan to be worse off than other plans in terms of deductibles and max out of pocket and benefits.

HoneyInsured's recommendation takes network size, benefits, your spendings all into account. For our suggested “Handpicked” plans, we also automatically filter out plans that are clearly worse off in terms of benefits and other measures.
