 What are the differences between on exchange (Obamacare) plans, off exchange plans, short term plans and going uninsured? Get a qualified health plans to avoid federal tax penalties. If you are not covered by your job, these are your 4 options:
</p>
<ol>
  <li class = "row-bottom-15">
    <b>On-Exchange Plan</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can find On-Exchange Plans at https://honeyinsured.com or Healthcare.gov.
      </li>
      <li>
        These plans are subject to strict standards and must cover preventative care, pre-existing conditions and essential health benefits (including pregnancy, prescription drug, birth control, and emergency)**.
      </li>
      <li>
        You must enroll in On-Exchange Plan between November 1, 2015 and January 31, 2016. On other dates, you can enroll if you have a qualifying event*.
      </li>
      <li>
        On exchange plans are eligible for government help in tax subsidies and cost-sharing.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class = "row-bottom-15">
    <b>Off-Exchange Plan</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Off-Exchange Plans, like On-Exchange Plans, have the same enrollment deadlines and strict coverage standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        You cannot enroll in Off-Exchange Plans on Healthcare.gov. However, we show and can enroll you in select Off-Exchange Plans. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Unlike On-Exchange plans, you cannot get tax subsidies and cost-sharing help.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class = "row-bottom-15">
    <b>Short-Term Plan</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Short-term plans are not subject to the strict standards as Off-Exchange and On-Exchange plans. That means that the insurance company can choose to not cover your pre-existing conditions. You can also be denied coverage for non-health reasons.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can enroll in a short-term plan any time during the year.
      </li>
      <li>
        Short-term plans also do not exempt you from the tax penalty.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li class = "row-bottom-15">
    <b>Uninsured</b>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can always choose to go uninsured or without coverage. Going uninsured means that you’ll pay a tax penalty and for all your medical expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tax penalty for 2016 is the greater of 1) $695/adult, $347.50/child (family max $2,085) or 2) 2.5% of your household income that is above the tax return filing threshold for your filing status.
      </li>
      <li>
        To see how much you’ll pay in tax penalty and under different accident scenarios like “Bad Flu” or “Cancer”, type in your zip code below, and we'll do the math for you.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
