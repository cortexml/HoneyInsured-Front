 During insurance shopping, the user is oftentimes left lost without data or guides to make the most informated choice. To add to the problem, insurance companies have their own marketing tactics. Don't worry, we researched into the traps and reveal how HoneyInsured automatically hacks your way into better health insurance.

    Firstly, one of the common strategies that insurance companies use is that they offer cheap plans but the plans have a very small network of doctors. Our recommendation takes network size into account and show you that information. We’re also the first insurance comparison site to show you that.

    The second common problem is that insurance plans are priced according to how the average person utilizes the different benefits and not you. For example you have a condition where you’re spend a lot on drugs but almost nothing on primary care visits, then you should find a plan that has a better benefits for drugs. We allow you to tell us that information and find you the plan that fits your situation.

      The third issue, is that in places with many plans, it’s common for a plan to be worse off than another in terms of deductibles and max out of pocket but may just be a dollar cheaper. But it’s very hard to notice that kind of problem, because current sites only let you sort based on premium.

      Our suggestions automatically filter out plans that are clearly worse off and we are also the first and only site to create a visualization to help you spot these issues. Basically you can see all your plans on a 2d scatterplot, so you can easily see the tradeoff between premiums vs deductible and premiums vs max out of pocket. During beta testing, people found it revolutionary because they can see all their options in one glance instead of flipping through multiple pages.

    Last of all, consumers buy plans without their doctors covered. We ask for your doctors and make sure they’re in-network.
